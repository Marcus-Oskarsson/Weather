## Description
A website that displays the current weather. Weather are fetched from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and the user gets to search for a city. The weather is presented in a simple line chart built with [Chart.js](chartjs.org/).

## Project goals
- use fetch and display content dynamically.
- Handle user interaction with eventListeners.
- Visualize information using chart.js or similar libraries.

## improvements to be made
- Video sizes are too big, needs a fix. Could use an image as background while video is loading.
- Let user save cities for easier access.
- Better icons?
